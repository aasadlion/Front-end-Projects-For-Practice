# Front-end-projects-for-practice
### Practical Front-End Projects with Pure Javascript, CSS, and HTML
### A collection of my practical front-end projects. The main purpose is to learn.  

## Projects
There are many developed projects that you can review now.







#### Running locally
It's so simple. Clone or download the repository, open project directory and open index.html in your browser. As I mentioned above, there is not any bundler and all scripts have been injected in the HTML.
